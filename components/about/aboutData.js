    bio: `Thanks for visiting my portfolio!

I’m a smart contract engineer building on the EVM ecosystem and a full-stack web developer in both Web2 and Web3. I’m in this space because I believe DeFi and decentralized technologies can truly disrupt and liberate the internet and financial system.

I’m also the co-founder of Give Protocol, a no-loss donation platform for sustainable giving. We’ve gone through several incubation programs, including Scroll Open Campus Season 2 and the Blockchain For Good Alliance (BGA). You can explore my experience section to learn more about our journey.

The internet is my constant source of inspiration. It’s where I explore new ideas, try out new tech stacks, and keep learning. Outside of tech, I occasionally dive into macroeconomics, philosophy, and psychology - simply because the world is so interesting, and people love making it complicated as hell.

Every story starts somewhere. If you’d like to connect, feel free to drop me a DM through the contact page!`,
